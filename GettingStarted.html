<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Thank you for trying out the Web Security Dojo!</p>
<p>Here you&#8217;ll find popular tools for testing web application security, along with some targets containing intentional vulnerabilities.  Web Security Dojo is intended to be used as a training environment, and probably shouldn&#8217;t be used as a pentesting platform due to the vulnerable services included.  For a project better suited to performing security assessments see <a href="https://www.kali.org/" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Kali Linux</a>.</p>
<p>To get started, fire up Firefox using the menu or icon above and connect to <span class="caps">DVWA</span> by clicking the <span class="caps">DVWA</span> link on the Firefox home page. Alternatively, just surf to <a href="http://dvwa.local/dvwa" target="_blank">http://dvwa.local/dvwa</a></p>
<span class="caps">DVWA</span> has good help and multiple difficulty settings you can try dependent on your skill level.</p>
<p>Another good learning tool to try is WebGoat, which can be started by going to Applications &#8594; Targets &#8594; WebGoat NG Start.  The main page will load in Firefox on startup.  If you need to get back to the main page, it&#8217;s available in Bookmarks &#8594; Vulnerable Web Apps or on the Firefox home page like the rest of the targets.</p>
<p>After you poke around manually for a while, you will probably want to start using a intercept tool like Burp Proxy to view and modify the traffic.  Start with Applications &#8594; Tools &#8594; Burp Suite Free and then use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mm3-proxyswitch/"  target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">MM3 Proxy Switch</a> via the pull down menu next to the <span class="caps">URL</span> bar in Firefox to select Burp Suite.  Then all your traffic will flow through Burp Proxy.  To have your traffic flow normally, just click the main MM3 button to turn off the proxy (it will change color from dark red [on] to grey [off]).</p>
<p>These exercises show you the basics you need to start exploring the dojo on your own.  Other hints can be found in the Applications &#8594; Documentation section, which contains some useful free documentation on web application testing and some of the specific target documentation. Also, we have a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=ABEB0E4FE82D7635">video page on Youtube</a> with a few video tutorials.  More to come soon.</p>
<p>We highly recommend you use the Zim Wiki or one of the text editors to take notes on your tests and findings.  Taking good notes is an essential skill for security testing.</p>
<p>If you wish to make changes or update the system, the username and password are both <b>dojo</b>.</p>
<p>There is no root user, if you need to do something as root, use <b>sudo</b> and the dojo password.</p>

<p>Web security dojo is an open source project, and we welcome contributions or collaboration with other projects. Our target and tool installs are completely scripted in bash. <a href="http://bit.ly/websecdojoSF" target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Security Dojo</a>There is some development documentation in the docs/dev-related directory to get you started, or please contact us with any questions.</p>
